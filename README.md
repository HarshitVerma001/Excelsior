## **2. Description**
The game is created using 2D game framework called Phaser. The rendering method used for creation is Canvas and WebGL. The game is loaded on the BrowserJS when the link is opened. The dataset and code gets instantiated in the cookie storage. Then, on start of game, the character 'Dino' is bought to motion using animations and Phaser. The character keeps on running till it hits and obstacles or link is closed. As we move forward, the score keeps in increasing. The controls avaiable are jump which is achieved via pressing spacebar. The obstacles included are cactus (ground obstacle) and birds (air obstacle). The objective is to avoid hitting both the obstacles till maximum time possible by timing jump in such a manner that obstacle are not hit. The height of bird keeps on varying on increasing duration of gameplay. On hitting the obstacle, the games get over by moving to starting screen and high score gets updated.
